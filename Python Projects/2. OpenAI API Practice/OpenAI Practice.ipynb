    "As a distinguished AI Developer, you've been selected by Peterman Reality Tours, an internationally acclaimed tourism company, to undertake an influential project. This project requires you to harness the potential of OpenAI's API, specifically using its state-of-the-art language model, GPT-3.5 Turbo, to create an AI-powered travel guide for the culturally rich city of Paris.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your creation will become a virtual Parisian expert, delivering valuable insights into the city's iconic landmarks and hidden treasures. The AI will respond intelligently to a set of common questions, providing a more engaging and immersive travel planning experience for the clientele of Peterman Reality Tours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate aspiration is a user-friendly, AI-driven travel guide that significantly enhances the exploration of Paris. This project will not only improve Peterman Reality Tours' customer service, but also solidify their place at the forefront of AI-enhanced innovation in the global tourism industry. Users will be able to pre-define their questions and receive well-informed answers from the AI, making the travel planning process seamless and intuitive."
